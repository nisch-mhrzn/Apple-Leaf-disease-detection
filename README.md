# New-apple-leaf

This is my minor project I made using Python and Streamlit. The project is based on detecting apple leaf diseases and provding their treatment.

First of all it is recommended to work on an virtual environment for a project as your main python package directory does not get flooded with unnecessary python packages.

# To set up a virtual environment 
 pip install virtualenv
 
 # Create  a virtual environment
  python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>

# Activating the environment
virtual-environment-name/bin/activate
  
 # Installing required modules
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  
  After that open the main.py folder. make sure to activate the virtual envirnoment. Make sure to correct the path of the .h5 model.
  Then in the cmd type:
  streamlit run main.py
